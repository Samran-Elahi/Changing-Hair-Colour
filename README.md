# Changing-Hair-Colour
 Our goal was to use conditional GANs to create a model that changes the hair colours.
 
 
 ## Abstract :
 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been used in many different tasks of
 image to image translation. Our goal was to use conditional GANs to create a model
 that changes the hair colour. We did analysis on Hair GAN[1] and found that it was
 not generalizing well and not giving good results on asianâ€™s so,
 we created our own dataset by using this model and tried different configurations of
 swish activation (introduced by google in 2017) on pix2pix GAN [2] and compared the
 results.
 
 ## Results :
 We found that the best approach is to use swish in the generator of the model pix2pix as it gives more sharp and better results. Following is a comparison of all approaches. 
 The results of simple pix2pix GAN and pix2pix with swish in generator are almost the same and are better then other approaches.
